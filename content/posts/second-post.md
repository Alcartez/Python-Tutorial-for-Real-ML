Oompa Loompa , yet Snekkity Snek.
I'm back.

Hello everyone , 
Time for some Sneky Snek.
I mean Python.

```python
print("Hello Mom")
Question = "Why are you so fat ?"
print(Question)
```
So this is how to start coding
Make sure you show your mother your first code. 
She'll be proud. 

Anyways back to reality.

More python.
So , what do we do now ?

Lets go over some conditions

```python
print("Hey Mom.")
Answer = input("Are you there ? \n1. Type 1 for Yes \n.2. Any other number for no. \nEnter a number :"))
if type(Answer) != int :
    print("Wow , you're one stupid retarded mofo ain't you ?")
else :
    if Answer == 1 :
        print("You're still fat.")
    else :
        print("Couldn't fit through the door it seems.")
```

Here , another piece of code to make your mama proud.
